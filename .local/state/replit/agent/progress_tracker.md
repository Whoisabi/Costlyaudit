[x] 8. Enhanced Cost Analysis Features (November 22, 2025):
    - ✓ Extended schema with detailed cost data types (services, resources, regions, recommendations)
    - ✓ Backend routes added:
      - /api/costs/services - Returns ALL services with costs
      - /api/costs/services/:serviceCode/resources - Returns resource breakdown by region
      - /api/costs/recommendations - Returns RI, Savings Plans, Rightsizing recommendations
    - ✓ Created AllServicesCosts component (clickable services showing resources by region)
    - ✓ Created CostRecommendations component (tabbed view for all recommendation types)
    - ✓ Updated Dashboard with global credit toggle and new components
    - ✓ CostSummary now supports both standalone and controlled usage
    - ✓ Added actionable error messages with remediation guidance
    - ✓ Properly cached queries to avoid excessive API calls
    - ✓ All features tested and working correctly
    - ✓ Ready for multi-account enhancement (TODO added for future work)

[x] 9. Data Accuracy Fix - Removed Misleading Benchmark Savings (November 22, 2025):
    - ✓ Identified critical issue: Benchmarks showed hardcoded fake savings ($20 for S3) while Cost Explorer showed real costs ($1.26)
    - ✓ Removed ALL hardcoded estimatedSavings values across all benchmarks:
      - EC2 (stopped instances, elastic IPs, volumes, snapshots)
      - RDS (stopped instances, old gen types, old snapshots)
      - S3 (versioning, lifecycle policies)
      - DynamoDB (provisioned capacity)
      - ElastiCache, Redshift, Lambda
    - ✓ Set all savings to 0 with comment: "Requires Steampipe integration for accurate calculation"
    - ✓ Updated Benchmarks UI to show "TBD" instead of "$0.00" for all zero savings
    - ✓ Added prominent warning card explaining savings aren't available yet
    - ✓ Dashboard continues to show accurate Cost Explorer data (real AWS billing)
    - ✓ No more misleading data - users won't see fake savings numbers anymore
    - 📝 Future work: Integrate Steampipe/Powerpipe for accurate benchmark savings calculations

[x] 10. Steampipe/Powerpipe Integration for Accurate Benchmark Savings (November 22, 2025):
    - ✓ Installed Steampipe v2.3.2 and Powerpipe v1.4.2 CLI tools in .local/bin
    - ✓ Installed AWS plugin for Steampipe (v1.28.0)
    - ✓ Installed AWS Thrifty mod with 55 pre-built cost optimization benchmarks
    - ✓ Created SteampipeService module (server/steampipe-service.ts):
      - Runs Powerpipe benchmarks via child_process
      - Parses JSON output from Steampipe
      - Supports all 7 service benchmarks (EC2, RDS, S3, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Redshift, Lambda)
      - Extracts resource IDs and types from ARNs
    - ✓ Created PricingService module (server/pricing-service.ts):
      - Calculates AWS resource costs using pricing estimates
      - Supports EC2 (40+ instance types), RDS, EBS, S3, DynamoDB
      - Calculates potential savings based on optimization type (stopped, idle, rightsizing)
      - Methods for stopped instances, idle resources, unattached volumes, old snapshots
    - ✓ Updated backend routes (/api/benchmarks/run):
      - Added `useSteampipe` parameter to enable Steampipe mode
      - Integrates SteampipeService + PricingService for accurate savings
      - Calculates savings per control/resource
      - Falls back to AWS SDK if Steampipe fails
      - Returns total estimated savings in cents
    - ✓ Application compiles and runs successfully
    - 📝 Next: Update frontend to enable Steampipe mode via toggle/setting
    - 📝 Next: Test with real AWS credentials to verify accuracy
    - 📝 Next: Add caching to avoid excessive Steampipe CLI calls
